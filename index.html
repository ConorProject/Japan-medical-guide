The research revealed that nearly every Japanese cold medicine contains codeine or ephedrine, yet travelers face potential arrest and 23-day detention for bringing identical substances without proper permits. This distinction between domestic availability and import restrictions highlights Japan's complex drug control philosophy that separates internal medical practice from external security concerns.",

        <p style="margin-bottom: 25px; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
            Japan has a two-agency system for medication imports: the <strong>Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)</strong> determines if you need permits, while <strong>Japan Customs</strong> handles declaration requirements at the border. Our classification reflects both agencies' requirements to give you clear, actionable guidance.
        </p>

        <div class="classification-item classification-prohibited">
            <div class="classification-title">PROHIBITED</div>
            <div class="classification-description">
                These substances are illegal to bring into Japan under any circumstances. Possession can result in arrest, detention, and deportation.
            </div>
            <div class="classification-example">
                <strong>Examples:</strong> Adderall (amphetamine), Sudafed (pseudoephedrine)

        </div>

        <div class="classification-item classification-restricted">

            <div class="classification-description">
                These medications require specific action at customs. You <strong>must</strong> use the Red Channel and declare them, even if no advance permit is needed. This includes all psychotropic substances.
            </div>
            <div class="classification-example">
                <strong>Examples:</strong> Xanax (alprazolam), Clonazepam, Vyvanse (requires permit)

            <div class="classification-title">PERMITTED</div>
            <div class="classification-description">
                These medications can be brought through the Green Channel with standard documentation (prescription bottle, doctor's letter recommended). No special permits or declarations required.
            </div>

            <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">
                A medication can be "permitted" by MHLW (no advance permit needed) but still "restricted" in our system because Customs requires mandatory declaration. This prevents the confusion that causes problems for travelers who assume "permitted" means "no customs action needed."

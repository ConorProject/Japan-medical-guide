# The Refined 5-Step Research Methodology

## Step 1: The Official Classification Check
**Action:** Go directly to the Narcotics Control Department (NCD) and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) websites.

**Goal:** Search for the medication's active ingredient. Your only goal in this step is to find which list it appears on:
- Narcotics
- Stimulants or Stimulant Raw Materials
- Psychotropics
- General Prescription Drug (i.e., not on any of the lists above)

## Step 2: The "Supporting Documents" Hunt (The New, Critical Step)
**Action:** On the same official government pages from Step 1, actively look for and click on any links labeled "FAQ," "Q&A," "Examples," "Sample Form," or "Detailed Guide."

**Goal:** This is where the vital context is found. A drug might be on the "Stimulant" list, but the "Sample Form" might, as we discovered, show a clear process for travelers. This step prevents misinterpreting a difficult process as an impossible one.

## Step 3: The Embassy Cross-Reference
**Action:** Search the medication pages on the websites of the U.S. Embassy, Australian Embassy, and U.K. Embassy in Japan.

**Goal:** Confirm your understanding from Step 1 & 2. Embassies are excellent at translating complex rules into direct advice. If they say "Do not bring this drug," treat it as a major red flag, even if you found a theoretical legal path.

## Step 4: The "Absence as Evidence" Test
**Action:** Review the embassy sites again. Ask yourself, "Is this drug I'm researching notably absent from their lists of common problem drugs?"

**Goal:** As we learned with Tramadol, sometimes the fact that a drug is not being warned about, when other similar drugs are, is a strong piece of evidence that it falls under standard rules.

## Step 5: The Real-World Sanity Check
**Action:** Only after the first four steps give you a clear answer, do a quick search on sites like Reddit (r/JapanTravel) or TripAdvisor for "Bringing [Drug Name] to Japan 2024" (or the current/next year).

**Goal:** You are not looking for legal advice here. You are looking for recent, first-hand experiences that might add important context to the "notes" section of your guide, such as "Travelers report that customs officials are especially interested in this medication, so have your doctor's letter easily accessible."

By adding the explicit **Step 2: "Hunt for Supporting Documents,"** this refined process is now far more robust. It forces the researcher to find the specific, contextual examples that can completely change the interpretation of a rule, making it much less likely that we would misclassify a medication like Vyvanse or Tramadol again.

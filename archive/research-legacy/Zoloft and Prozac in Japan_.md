# **An Expert Report on the Personal Importation of Sertraline (Zoloft) and Fluoxetine (Prozac) into Japan**

## **I. Executive Summary**

A comprehensive analysis of Japan's pharmaceutical regulations reveals that the antidepressant medications Zoloft, with the active ingredient Sertraline, and Prozac, with the active ingredient Fluoxetine, do **not** receive the same import and customs treatment. The fundamental divergence stems from their respective regulatory statuses within Japan. Sertraline is an approved and prescribed medication in the country, whereas Fluoxetine is not. This distinction has profound implications for travelers and, most significantly, for long-term residents.

Both medications are classified as "permitted" for personal import by a traveler, meaning neither appears on Japan's lists of strictly prohibited substances, such as amphetamines, or on the lists of specially controlled narcotics requiring the most stringent permissions.1 The import procedure for both is governed by a uniform principle based on quantity: a supply of one month or less can be brought into Japan for personal use without requiring any special certificate or pre-authorization.2

However, for any quantity exceeding a one-month supply, a traveler must obtain a pre-approved import certificate known as a **Yunyu Kakunin-sho**.2 The application process for this certificate is identical for both Sertraline and Fluoxetine, as neither is classified as a narcotic or a specially controlled psychotropic that would trigger additional oversight from the Narcotics Control Department.

The critical difference, and the primary source of potential risk and complication, lies in the strategy for long-term supply. As Sertraline is approved in Japan, an expatriate or long-term resident can import an initial supply with a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* and subsequently transition to the Japanese healthcare system, obtaining ongoing prescriptions from a local physician.6 In contrast, a user of Fluoxetine faces a significant logistical challenge. Because the drug is not approved for prescription in Japan, a long-term resident cannot obtain it locally.5 Their only legal recourse is to maintain a prescription from their home country and engage in repeated personal importations, a process made more complex by the recent global discontinuation of the brand-name Prozac by its manufacturer, Eli Lilly.8

Therefore, travelers must meticulously calculate their required supply to determine if a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is necessary. If so, they must apply for it well in advance of their departure through the official Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) online portal. Individuals planning a long-term stay must carefully consider the significant differences in the long-term viability of maintaining a supply of these two medications.

## **II. The Regulatory Framework for Personal Medication Importation in Japan**

The personal importation of any medication into Japan is a tightly controlled process overseen by a robust legal and administrative framework. Understanding this structure is essential for ensuring compliance and avoiding potentially severe legal consequences. The system is predicated on a risk-based hierarchy, where different categories of drugs are subject to varying levels of scrutiny and control.

### **Governing Legislation**

All matters concerning the importation, safety, and use of medications are governed by two principal pieces of legislation:

* **The Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (PMD Act):** This is the foundational law that regulates the entire lifecycle of pharmaceuticals, quasi-drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices in Japan.10 It establishes the definitions for different drug categories, outlines the requirements for manufacturing and marketing approval, and sets the general rules for personal importation.12 The PMD Act is the primary source of the "one-month rule" for prescription drugs.  
* **The Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law:** This law provides a separate and more stringent layer of control for substances that have a recognized potential for abuse, dependence, and harm to public health.15 It specifically governs the handling of narcotics, psychotropics, and their raw materials, often requiring special, advance permission for import, even for personal medical use.3

### **Key Regulatory Bodies**

Navigating the import process requires interacting with or, at a minimum, understanding the jurisdiction of several key governmental bodies:

* **Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW):** The MHLW is the chief administrative body responsible for Japan's public health and social welfare systems. In the context of medication importation, it sets the overarching policies and regulations.2 Its regional bureaus, such as the Kanto-Shin'etsu Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare for arrivals into Tokyo, are the specific entities that review applications and issue the  
  *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.4  
* **Narcotics Control Department (NCD):** Operating as a specialized division within the MHLW, the NCD is exclusively responsible for enforcing the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law.21 It handles the separate and more rigorous permission process required for bringing narcotics (e.g., morphine, fentanyl) and certain designated psychotropics into Japan.2  
* **Japan Customs:** This is the frontline enforcement agency at all ports of entry. Customs officers are tasked with inspecting baggage and ensuring that all imported goods, including personal medications, comply with the regulations established by the MHLW and NCD.20 They are the officials who will ask to see a traveler's  
  *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* or other required permits upon arrival.19

### **The Japanese Drug Classification System**

The legal treatment of any given medication hinges entirely on its classification within the Japanese system. The regulations a traveler must follow are determined by which of these legal categories their medication falls into. The primary classifications relevant to this analysis are:

* **Prescription Drug:** This is a broad category for drugs that, under the PMD Act, are designated by the MHLW as requiring a prescription from a physician, dentist, or veterinarian for their safe use.11 This is the default classification for most common therapeutic medicines that are not otherwise specially controlled. The personal import limit for this category is a one-month supply without special permission.2  
* **Psychotropic Drug:** This is a specific legal designation under the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law for substances that affect the central nervous system and are habit-forming, but are deemed to pose a less severe risk than narcotics if abused.11 Japan maintains a specific list of these drugs, such as diazepam (Valium) and zolpidem (Ambien), and sets explicit quantity limits for their personal importation.20 Exceeding these limits requires documentation, and importing them in injectable form requires a  
  *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.20  
* **Narcotic:** Also defined under the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law, this category includes drugs with a high potential for abuse and severe harm, such as morphine, codeine, and fentanyl.11 The importation of any amount of a narcotic for personal use requires special advance permission from the NCD.2  
* **Stimulants and their Raw Materials:** This category, governed by the Stimulants Control Law, includes substances like amphetamine and methamphetamine. These are strictly prohibited from being imported into Japan, even with a valid foreign prescription for a condition such as ADHD.5

The structure of these regulations is not arbitrary; it is a deliberately constructed, risk-based framework. The quantity limits and procedural requirements are directly proportional to the perceived risk of abuse and potential harm to public health associated with each drug class. General prescription drugs, considered lowest risk in this context, have the most lenient rule (a one-month supply). Psychotropics are subject to more specific gram-based limits, reflecting a moderate risk. Narcotics, deemed highest risk, require pre-approval for any amount. Finally, stimulants are considered to pose an unacceptable risk and are banned entirely from personal import. A traveler's first and most crucial task is therefore to accurately determine where their medication fits within this legal hierarchy, as that determination dictates all subsequent actions required for compliance.

## **III. Analysis of Sertraline (Zoloft) for Personal Import**

The import treatment of Sertraline, the active ingredient in the brand-name drug Zoloft, is relatively straightforward due to its established status within the Japanese pharmaceutical system.

### **Regulatory Status in Japan: Approved and Available**

Sertraline is an approved prescription medication in Japan.27 It is legally prescribed by Japanese physicians for the treatment of various conditions, including depression, depressed states, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).28 The medication is available from multiple manufacturers within Japan, often under generic names such as Sertraline "Kyorin" or Sertraline "DSEP".28 Its approval and availability mean that it is a recognized and familiar substance to Japanese healthcare professionals and regulators.

### **Official Classification: Prescription Drug**

A thorough review of Japan's official lists of controlled substances confirms that Sertraline (and its common salt form, sertraline hydrochloride) is **not** classified as a Narcotic, a Psychotropic, or a Stimulant Raw Material.1 Its chemical structure and therapeutic action as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) do not place it into any of the categories requiring special handling by the Narcotics Control Department.30 Consequently, for the purposes of personal importation, Sertraline is treated as a general

**"Prescription Drug"** under the PMD Act.2

### **Import Regulations for Sertraline (Zoloft)**

As a standard prescription drug, the import rules for Sertraline are dictated by quantity:

* **Up to a 1-Month Supply:** A traveler may bring up to a one-month supply of Sertraline into Japan for their personal use without any special application or certificate.2 While no formal paperwork is required for this amount, it is a strongly recommended best practice to carry a copy of the doctor's prescription and to keep the medication in its original, pharmacy-labeled container. This documentation serves to readily explain the medication's purpose and legitimacy to a customs officer if questions arise.5  
* **More than a 1-Month Supply:** To legally import a quantity of Sertraline that exceeds a one-month supply, a traveler **must** apply for and receive a **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** (import certificate) *before* departing for Japan.2 This certificate, issued by the MHLW, serves as official proof that the larger quantity is for legitimate personal medical use. The certificate must be carried with the medication and presented to customs upon arrival.

### **Long-Term Supply for Expatriates**

The approved status of Sertraline in Japan provides a clear and viable pathway for long-term residents. An individual moving to Japan can legally import an initial supply (for example, for three to six months) by obtaining a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*. Once settled, they can then schedule an appointment with a Japanese physician or psychiatrist. By presenting their medical history and explaining their ongoing need for the medication, they can transition their care to the Japanese healthcare system and receive ongoing prescriptions locally.6 This makes the long-term management of treatment with Sertraline relatively uncomplicated for expatriates.

## **IV. Analysis of Fluoxetine (Prozac) for Personal Import**

The customs and import treatment of Fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac, presents a more complex and challenging scenario than that of Sertraline. This complexity arises directly from its regulatory status—or lack thereof—in Japan.

### **Regulatory Status in Japan: Not Approved**

The most critical fact differentiating Fluoxetine from Sertraline is that it is **not an approved medication** for marketing or prescription within Japan.26 While it is a widely used SSRI antidepressant globally, Japanese physicians cannot legally prescribe it.6

The reason for its non-approval is a matter of clinical and commercial history, not a prohibitive safety ban. The manufacturer, Eli Lilly, conducted clinical trials in Japan but ultimately decided to withdraw its application for approval after the trials yielded what were described as "disappointing" results.26 This decision was influenced by Japan's historically stringent drug approval standards, which often required new drugs to demonstrate superiority over existing treatments, not just efficacy against a placebo.26 Records show that Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fluoxetine in Japanese patients with Major Depressive Disorder were indeed conducted in the 2010s, but these did not culminate in the drug's entry into the Japanese market.36

### **Official Classification: Permissible Unapproved Prescription Drug**

Despite its unapproved status for domestic sale, Fluoxetine is **not** on Japan's lists of absolutely prohibited substances (like amphetamines) or specially controlled substances like Narcotics or Psychotropics.1 Therefore, for the specific purpose of

**personal importation by a traveler**, it is regulated under the general framework for a **"Prescription Drug"**.26 The Japanese system makes a distinction between prohibiting a substance outright and simply not approving it for domestic sale, allowing for its personal import under controlled conditions.

### **Import Legality and Regulations for Fluoxetine (Prozac)**

Because it is treated as a general prescription drug for import purposes, the rules for bringing Fluoxetine into Japan mirror those for Sertraline and are based on quantity:

* **Up to a 1-Month Supply:** A traveler can bring up to a one-month supply of Fluoxetine for their personal use without needing to obtain any special certificate in advance.2 It is imperative to carry a copy of the prescribing doctor's letter or prescription and to keep the medication in its original, clearly labeled container to prove its legitimacy.  
* **More than a 1-Month Supply:** To import more than a one-month supply of Fluoxetine, it is **mandatory** to obtain a **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** before arriving in Japan.26 The application process is the same as for any other non-controlled prescription drug and is managed through the MHLW.

The existence of a black market for popular but unapproved foreign medications like Prozac is noted in official guidance.33 Travelers are explicitly warned that purchasing such drugs illegally within Japan is a criminal act that can result in arrest and imprisonment, reinforcing the necessity of adhering strictly to the legal personal importation channel.

### **The Long-Term Supply Crisis for Fluoxetine Users**

For an individual planning a short-term visit, the import process for Fluoxetine is manageable. For a prospective long-term resident or expatriate, however, the situation is precarious and presents a significant, ongoing challenge. Since Fluoxetine cannot be prescribed by doctors in Japan and foreign prescriptions cannot be filled at Japanese pharmacies, there is no domestic path to obtaining refills.5

The only legal method for maintaining a supply is through continuous personal importation. This requires the individual to maintain a therapeutic relationship with a physician in their home country who is willing and able to provide ongoing prescriptions. The resident in Japan must then use these foreign prescriptions to apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* to authorize the import of each new supply, whether carried personally after a trip home or sent via international mail (a process which has its own complex customs clearance procedures).6

This already difficult situation is further complicated by a major development in the global pharmaceutical market. In late 2024, the original manufacturer, Eli Lilly, announced the **global discontinuation of brand-name Prozac** production due to evolving business priorities.8 While the decision was not related to safety or efficacy, it means that the familiar brand-name drug will no longer be available for sourcing and import. Long-term users will be forced to switch to a generic version of fluoxetine. Although chemically equivalent, this change can be a source of anxiety and perceived differences in effect for patients who have been stable on the brand-name product for many years. The combination of non-approval in Japan and the global discontinuation of the brand-name product creates a uniquely challenging and logistically burdensome scenario for any expatriate reliant on this specific medication.

## **V. Comparative Analysis: Zoloft vs. Prozac Import Treatment**

While the immediate, short-term customs procedures for bringing a personal supply of Zoloft (Sertraline) and Prozac (Fluoxetine) into Japan appear identical, their underlying regulatory statuses create vastly different contexts and long-term prospects for users. The core distinction is that Sertraline is an integrated part of the Japanese healthcare system, while Fluoxetine is an external medication that can only be brought in under specific, limited conditions. The following table provides a direct comparison to clarify these critical differences.

| Feature | Sertraline (Zoloft) | Fluoxetine (Prozac) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Approved for Prescription in Japan?** | Yes 27 | No 6 |
| **Official Import Classification** | Prescription Drug 2 | Prescription Drug (Unapproved) 26 |
| **Requires Special NCD Permission?** | No 1 | No 1 |
| **Importing a ≤ 1-Month Supply** | Permitted without special certificate. 2 | Permitted without special certificate. 2 |
| **Importing a \> 1-Month Supply** | **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** required. 4 | **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** required. 26 |
| **Availability from Japanese Doctors** | Available. Can transition to local care. 6 | Not available. Cannot be prescribed. 5 |
| **Long-Term Supply Strategy** | Straightforward. Import initial supply with a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*, then see a Japanese doctor for ongoing prescriptions. | Complex. Must maintain a foreign prescription and repeatedly use the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* process for personal imports. 6 |
| **Manufacturer Status** | Widely available from multiple manufacturers, including generics. 28 | Brand-name Prozac is being discontinued globally by Eli Lilly. Users must rely on generic fluoxetine for import. 8 |

## **VI. Personal Importation Procedures and Quantity Limits**

Japan's regulations for the personal import of medicines and related products are based on clear quantity limits. Adhering to these limits determines whether a traveler can enter with their items without pre-authorization or if they must complete the formal application process for an import certificate.

### **Importation Without Special Permission (The Default Rule)**

A traveler can bring the following categories and quantities of products into Japan for personal use without needing to apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* or any other special certificate 2:

* **Prescription Drugs:** Up to a **one-month supply**. This is the controlling regulation for both Sertraline and Fluoxetine.  
* **Non-Prescription / Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs:** Up to a **two-month supply**.  
* **Vitamins:** Up to a **four-month supply**.  
* **Cosmetics:** Up to **24 pieces per item**. For example, a traveler could bring 24 lipsticks, regardless of brand or color.2  
* **Injectable Drugs:** Up to a **one-month supply**, but only if they are in a "Pre-filled Syringe" or "Self-injection Kit" format, such as those used for insulin or certain biologics.2

It is crucial to understand that these quantity allowances are contingent on the ingredients of the products. Even if an OTC medication is within the two-month limit, it is strictly prohibited if it contains banned substances. The most common examples are products containing stimulants like **Pseudoephedrine** (found in many decongestants like Sudafed and Actifed) or certain levels of **Codeine**.5 Travelers must verify the active ingredients of all medications, including common OTC remedies, before packing.

### **When is a Yunyu Kakunin-sho Required?**

A traveler must complete the application process and obtain a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* *before* arriving in Japan if they intend to bring any of the following 2:

* A quantity of **prescription medication** that exceeds a one-month supply.  
* A quantity of **non-prescription (OTC) medication** that exceeds a two-month supply.  
* Any quantity of an **injectable drug** that is not in a pre-filled syringe or self-injection kit. A *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is also required for pre-filled kits if the quantity exceeds a one-month supply.  
* A quantity of **medical devices** (e.g., CPAP machines, nebulizers) that exceeds the personal limit of one set.

## **VII. A Comprehensive Guide to the Yunyu Kakunin-sho Application**

The *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is the official document that authorizes the import of medication quantities exceeding the standard personal use limits. Obtaining this certificate is a mandatory prerequisite for bringing a larger supply into Japan.

### **Clarifying Terminology: Yakkan Shoumei vs. Yunyu Kakunin-sho**

Travelers researching this topic will frequently encounter two terms: *Yakkan Shoumei* and *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*. It is important to understand that **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** is the current, official name for the "Import Confirmation Certificate".19 The term

*Yakkan Shoumei* is an older name for the same document and is still widely found in older official guidance, online forums, and informational websites.4 For all current applications and communications,

*Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is the correct term. The purpose of the certificate is to provide formal confirmation from the MHLW that the specified medications are for the applicant's personal use and that their importation does not violate Japanese law.45

### **The MHLW Online Application Portal: The Official Method**

Historically, applications were submitted by post or email. However, as of February 1, 2023, the MHLW has implemented a dedicated online portal for these applications. This is now the official and most efficient method for obtaining a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.46 Travelers should use this portal and disregard older guides that describe a paper-based process.

* **Official Portal Link:** https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en 2

The online process streamlines the procedure significantly:

1. **Create an Account:** The applicant first registers for an account on the portal.  
2. **Complete Online Application:** The applicant fills in the required information directly into the web-based forms.  
3. **Upload Documents:** All necessary supporting documents are uploaded as digital files (e.g., PDF).  
4. **Submit and Await Review:** The application is submitted electronically to the appropriate regional Bureau of Health and Welfare.  
5. **Receive Certificate:** Once approved, the completed and stamped *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is issued electronically and can be downloaded from the portal or received via email. This eliminates postal delays.46

### **Required Documentation Checklist**

A successful application depends on providing complete and accurate documentation. The following table serves as a checklist for the items that must be prepared for upload to the online portal.

| Document | Description & Key Requirements | Supporting Snippets |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Doctor's Prescription / Letter** | Must be a clear, legible copy of a valid prescription or a detailed letter from the prescribing physician. It must be signed by the doctor and clearly state: the patient's full name, the medical condition being treated, the name of the medication, the dosage, and the total quantity to be imported. A recent date (e.g., within the last 6 months) is advisable. | 4 |
| **2\. Product Information** | Details about each medication, including the brand and generic name, manufacturer, active ingredients, and strength (e.g., 100 mg tablets). This information is entered into the "Explanation of Pharmaceutical Product" section of the online form and can typically be found on the pharmacy's information leaflet or the original packaging. | 4 |
| **3\. Flight Itinerary** | A copy of the confirmed e-ticket or an official flight itinerary from the airline. This document must show the traveler's full name (matching the prescription), the arrival date, the flight number, and the specific port of entry in Japan (e.g., Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport). This is a mandatory attachment. | 4 |
| **4\. Application Form Data** | The information previously submitted on paper forms like the "Import Report of Medication" is now entered directly into the fields of the MHLW online portal. | 2 |

### **Application Timeline and Best Practices**

* **When to Apply:** Although the online system is efficient and can sometimes process applications within a few business days, official guidance recommends applying at least **one month prior to departure**.45 This provides a safe buffer to handle any potential queries or delays.  
* **Contact Information:** The online application will be routed to the correct regional MHLW office based on the specified port of arrival. For inquiries, the primary email addresses are yakkan@mhlw.go.jp for airports in Eastern Japan (including Tokyo's Narita and Haneda) and kiyakuji@mhlw.go.jp for airports in Western Japan (including Osaka's Kansai and Nagoya's Chubu).19  
* **Accuracy is Paramount:** The details on the application—traveler's name, medication name, and quantity—must exactly match the prescription and the physical medication being carried. Any discrepancies can invalidate the certificate. The *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*, once issued, must not be altered in any way.4

## **VIII. Navigating Customs and Arrival in Japan**

Proper preparation for the final step—passing through Japanese customs—is essential for a smooth entry process.

### **Declaration**

All passengers arriving in Japan are required to complete a customs declaration.23 This can be done using a paper form provided on the aircraft or ship, or, more conveniently, via the electronic "Visit Japan Web" service prior to arrival.23

The declaration form includes questions about carrying restricted or prohibited items. The most prudent approach for a traveler with a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is to be prepared to declare the medication. User experiences suggest that if you are carrying a quantity of a non-controlled prescription drug that is *within* the one-month personal use limit, you may not be required to make a positive declaration, as you are not technically exceeding the allowance.34 However, if you have a

*Yunyu Kakunin-sho* for a larger amount, you are carrying a quantity that would otherwise be restricted, and you should be prepared to declare it and present the certificate. Answering all questions on the declaration form truthfully is mandatory.

### **Presenting Documents**

The traveler must have all relevant documents readily accessible in their carry-on luggage. This includes:

* The printed **Yunyu Kakunin-sho** (a clear copy is acceptable).4  
* The original **doctor's prescription** or a detailed letter from the physician.5  
* The **medications themselves**, which must be kept in their original, pharmacy-labeled bottles or packaging.5 Do not consolidate pills into unmarked containers.

These items should be kept together for easy presentation to a customs officer if requested.

### **What to Expect**

For travelers who have followed the procedures correctly and have all their paperwork in order, the process is typically straightforward. A customs officer may simply review the documents and wave the traveler through. In other cases, particularly if a declaration is made, the traveler might be directed to a secondary inspection area.52 There, an officer will more closely examine the

*Yunyu Kakunin-sho*, the prescription, and the medication itself to ensure everything matches. Based on traveler reports, this process is generally professional and may add between 10 to 40 minutes to the time it takes to clear customs.52

## **IX. Prohibited and Specially Controlled Substances: A Critical Warning**

While Sertraline and Fluoxetine are permissible for import under specific rules, it is vital to understand that Japan maintains a zero-tolerance policy for other substances. Failure to heed these warnings can result in the most severe consequences, including immediate arrest, detention, and prosecution, regardless of a traveler's intent or possession of a valid foreign prescription.

### **Absolutely Prohibited Stimulants**

The Stimulants Control Law strictly prohibits the importation of amphetamines and methamphetamines into Japan.3 This ban extends to prescription medications that are common in other countries. Specifically, medications used for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as

**Adderall (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine)** and **Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)** are illegal to bring into Japan.5 There are no exceptions for personal medical use. Travelers carrying these substances risk immediate arrest.43

### **Prohibited Over-the-Counter Ingredients**

Many common OTC cold, sinus, and allergy medications available in countries like the United States are also prohibited in Japan. This is because they contain stimulant ingredients, most notably **pseudoephedrine**, which is found in products like Sudafed, Actifed, and certain Vicks inhalers.5 Products containing codeine may also be restricted or prohibited depending on the concentration.33 Travelers must meticulously check the active ingredients of all OTC remedies before travel.

### **Narcotics and Other Specially Controlled Drugs**

For medications that are classified under Japanese law as **Narcotics** (e.g., morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl) or certain specially designated **Psychotropics** (e.g., methylphenidate/Ritalin), a different and more stringent application process is required.2 This process is managed by the

**Narcotics Control Department (NCD)** and is separate from the standard *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* application handled by the regional MHLW bureaus.21 This report confirms that neither Sertraline nor Fluoxetine falls into this high-control category, and therefore, the NCD application process is not relevant for these two specific medications.

## **X. Final Recommendations and Compliance Checklist**

Navigating Japan's pharmaceutical import regulations requires diligence and advance planning. The legal framework is strict, but compliance is achievable by following the official procedures. The primary distinction between importing Sertraline (Zoloft) and Fluoxetine (Prozac) is not the short-term customs procedure, which is identical for both, but their long-term availability within Japan. Sertraline's approved status offers a pathway to local care, while Fluoxetine's unapproved status creates a significant and permanent logistical challenge for long-term residents.

The following checklist provides a step-by-step guide to ensure a compliant and stress-free process for travelers carrying either medication.

1. **\[ \] Verify Medication Status:** Confirm that Sertraline is an approved drug in Japan, while Fluoxetine is not. Understand the implications of this for any long-term stay.  
2. **\[ \] Calculate Total Supply:** Accurately determine the number of days of your stay and the total quantity of medication required.  
3. **\[ \] Determine Need for *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*:** If your required supply of either Sertraline or Fluoxetine exceeds a one-month supply, you **must** obtain a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.  
4. **\[ \] Obtain Doctor's Prescription/Letter:** Secure a clear, signed, and recent prescription or a detailed letter from your physician for all medications you intend to carry.  
5. **\[ \] Gather All Digital Documents:** Prepare digital copies (e.g., PDF) of your prescription/doctor's letter, your confirmed flight itinerary, and the medication's product information.  
6. **\[ \] Apply Online via MHLW Portal:** Create an account on the official MHLW "Application for Import Confirmation" portal (https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en) and submit your application with all required documents. Initiate this process at least one month before your departure date.  
7. **\[ \] Receive and Print Certificate:** Once you receive the electronic *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* via email or portal download, print several copies to carry with you.  
8. **\[ \] Pack Correctly:** Keep all medications in their original, clearly labeled pharmacy containers. Pack them in your carry-on luggage, along with your printed *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* and the original doctor's prescription or letter.  
9. **\[ \] Prepare for Customs:** Have your documents and medications organized and ready for potential inspection upon arrival in Japan. Be prepared to declare them if required.  
10. **\[ \] Plan for Long-Term Stay:**  
    * **If using Sertraline:** Plan to establish care with a local Japanese physician to transition to a local prescription after your initial imported supply runs out.  
    * **If using Fluoxetine:** Develop a sustainable, long-term strategy for legally importing future supplies. This involves maintaining a relationship with a foreign doctor for prescriptions and being aware that you will need to source generic fluoxetine, as the Prozac brand has been discontinued globally.

# **A Comprehensive Guide to the Personal Importation of Lorazepam into Japan: Regulatory and Customs Procedures**

### **Executive Summary**

The personal importation of prescription medication into Japan is governed by a stringent and multi-layered regulatory framework. For travelers prescribed Lorazepam, understanding these regulations is critical to ensure compliance and avoid significant legal consequences. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Japanese laws and procedures governing the personal import of Lorazepam.

Lorazepam is definitively classified as a **Psychotropic** substance under Japan's *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.1 This classification is paramount, as it subjects Lorazepam to a specific set of rules that supersede the general regulations for prescription drugs. The primary threshold for importing Lorazepam without special permission is not the commonly cited "one-month supply," but a specific quantity based on the weight of the active ingredient. For Lorazepam, this limit is

**90 milligrams (mg)** total.2

Importing a quantity of 90 mg or less does not require advance permission, though carrying supporting medical documentation is strongly advised. Exceeding this 90 mg limit mandates that the traveler carry a specific medical certificate from their prescribing physician.2 Separately, importing more than a one-month supply of any prescription drug, including Lorazepam, requires an import certificate known as a

*Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.5 Travelers must assess their supply against both the weight and time-based limits and secure the necessary documentation for any threshold they exceed.

The customs declaration process presents a point of ambiguity. The declaration form explicitly asks travelers to declare "psychotropic substances".6 Given the severe penalties for false declarations, the most prudent and legally sound approach is to declare "Yes" and be prepared for a secondary inspection with all supporting documents readily available.

Finally, all medication must be for the traveler's personal use and must be carried by the traveler in their accompanied luggage. It is strictly prohibited to have prescription medications, particularly controlled substances, sent to Japan via mail or carried by a third party.4

## **Section 1: The Legal Framework for Pharmaceutical Imports in Japan**

Navigating Japan's rules for importing medication requires an understanding of the legal principles and the government bodies that enforce them. The system is characterized by a hierarchy of regulations, where general rules are often superseded by more specific controls for certain classes of drugs.

### **1.1 Governing Legislation and Key Principles**

The importation of all pharmaceutical products into Japan is primarily controlled by two key pieces of legislation: the *Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices* (commonly known as the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act) and the *Customs Law*.9 For controlled substances, a further and more stringent layer of regulation is applied under the

*Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.2

The foundational principle underpinning the entire framework for personal importation is that the medication must be exclusively for the traveler's own use.11 It is strictly prohibited to sell, transfer, or give away any personally imported medication to another individual.11 Furthermore, medication intended for personal use must be carried into the country by the traveler themselves in their accompanied baggage. It is illegal to import these medications via international mail or have them carried by a third party, including family or friends.4 Any medication sent by post is subject to seizure by Japan Customs.8

### **1.2 The Critical Classification of Lorazepam**

The single most important factor determining the import regulations for Lorazepam is its legal classification in Japan. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative used as an anxiolytic and sedative.13 It is legally available by prescription in Japan and sold under brand names such as WYPAX.15

According to the official Japanese Pharmacopoeia and drug databases, Lorazepam is definitively categorized as a **"Psychotropic"** substance under a specific Cabinet Order of the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.1 This classification is paramount because it removes Lorazepam from the general category of "prescription drugs" and places it into a special, more strictly regulated category. Consequently, the rules governing its importation are dictated not by the general guidelines for all medicines, but by the specific provisions for psychotropics.

This distinction is the source of significant confusion for many travelers. While general guidance often refers to a "one-month supply" limit for prescription drugs, this rule does not apply in the same way to psychotropics, which have their own unique set of regulations based on the specific substance and its total weight.

### **1.3 Key Regulatory Authorities and Their Roles**

Several government bodies are involved in the regulation and control of pharmaceutical imports, each with a distinct function:

* **Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW):** This is the central government ministry responsible for setting the overarching policy and legal framework for pharmaceuticals, public health, and welfare in Japan.5  
* **Regional Bureaus of Health and Welfare:** These are the operational branches of the MHLW located throughout Japan. They are responsible for processing applications for the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (import certificate) for general medications when quantities exceed standard limits. The two main bureaus for international travelers are the **Kanto-Shin'etsu Regional Bureau** (serving Narita and Haneda airports) and the **Kinki Regional Bureau** (serving Kansai and Chubu airports).9  
* **Narcotics Control Department (NCD):** This is a specialized division within the MHLW that operates under the authority of the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*. The NCD is the primary authority for all matters concerning the import and export of Narcotics, Stimulants, and **Psychotropics**, including Lorazepam. It sets the specific rules and quantity limits for these substances.4  
* **Japan Customs:** This is the law enforcement agency responsible for inspections at all ports of entry. Customs officers enforce the regulations set by the MHLW and NCD, inspect baggage, and review documentation such as import certificates and prescriptions.6

The relationship between these bodies creates a hierarchy of regulation. General rules for prescription drugs are issued by the MHLW and administered by the Regional Bureaus. However, for substances classified as psychotropic, the more specific and stringent rules established by the NCD take legal precedence. A traveler bringing Lorazepam into Japan must therefore primarily concern themselves with the regulations set forth by the Narcotics Control Department. Failure to recognize this hierarchy is a common pitfall that can lead to non-compliance.

## **Section 2: Permissible Quantities of Lorazepam for Personal Import**

The most critical piece of information for a traveler bringing Lorazepam to Japan is the exact quantity they can import without requiring special advance permission or documentation. This quantity is not based on a general time frame but on a specific weight limit for the active ingredient.

### **2.1 The Official Threshold for Lorazepam: 90 Milligrams**

According to the official list of psychotropic substances and their import limits published by Japan's Narcotics Control Department, a traveler may bring a total quantity of **90 mg** of the active ingredient Lorazepam into Japan for personal use without needing a special permit or a doctor's certificate under the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.2

It is essential to understand that this is a **total weight limit of the active ingredient**, not a limit on the number of pills or a "one-month supply." The number of tablets that this limit corresponds to will vary depending on the dosage of each tablet.

### **2.2 Calculating Your Total Dosage: A Practical Guide**

To ensure compliance, travelers must calculate the total amount of Lorazepam they intend to bring. This can be done using a simple formula:

(Number of tablets)×(Dosage per tablet in mg)=Total mg of Lorazepam  
The result of this calculation must be 90 mg or less to fall within the exemption limit.

**Example 1 (Within Limit):** A traveler has a prescription for 0.5 mg Lorazepam tablets and plans to bring 60 tablets for their trip.

* Calculation: 60 tablets×0.5 mg/tablet=30 mg  
* Result: 30 mg is well under the 90 mg limit. No special NCD documentation is required.

**Example 2 (Within Limit):** A traveler has a prescription for 2.0 mg Lorazepam tablets and plans to bring 40 tablets.

* Calculation: 40 tablets×2.0 mg/tablet=80 mg  
* Result: 80 mg is under the 90 mg limit. No special NCD documentation is required.

**Example 3 (Exceeds Limit):** A traveler has a prescription for 2.0 mg Lorazepam tablets and plans to bring 50 tablets.

* Calculation: 50 tablets×2.0 mg/tablet=100 mg  
* Result: 100 mg exceeds the 90 mg limit. This will trigger the requirement for additional documentation, as detailed in Section 3\.

This weight-based system is standard for all psychotropic drugs controlled in Japan. The existence of a deliberate, substance-specific system demonstrates that travelers cannot rely on general rules of thumb and must verify the exact limit for each specific medication they carry. The table below provides context by showing the limits for other common psychotropics.

**Table 1: Permissible Import Quantities for Common Psychotropics (Without Special Permission)**

| Substance (Active Ingredient) | Common Brand Names | Classification | Maximum Quantity (without permit/doctor's note) | Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lorazepam** | Ativan, Wypax | Psychotropic | **90 mg** | 2 |
| Alprazolam | Xanax, Solanax | Psychotropic | 72 mg | 2 |
| Diazepam | Valium, Cercine | Psychotropic | 1.2 g (1200 mg) | 2 |
| Clonazepam | Klonopin, Rivotril | Psychotropic | 180 mg | 3 |
| Zolpidem | Ambien, Myslee | Psychotropic | 300 mg | 2 |
| Methylphenidate | Ritalin, Concerta | Psychotropic | 2.16 g (2160 mg) | 2 |

## **Section 3: Procedural Requirements for Importation**

The procedures for legally importing Lorazepam depend entirely on the total quantity being carried. The requirements are divided into two distinct scenarios: importing a quantity at or below the 90 mg threshold, and importing a quantity above it.

### **Scenario A: Importing 90 mg or Less of Lorazepam**

For travelers whose total quantity of Lorazepam is 90 mg or less, the process is straightforward, as no special advance permissions are required.

#### **3.1 Required Permits**

If the total amount of Lorazepam is 90 mg or less, and the supply does not exceed one month, no special import permits are necessary.2 This means the traveler

**does not** need to apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (Import Certificate) and **does not** need to obtain any special permission from the Narcotics Control Department (NCD).

#### **3.2 Documentation and Best Practices (Highly Recommended)**

Even when no permits are required, it is a critical best practice to carry comprehensive supporting documentation to facilitate a smooth customs inspection if questioned. Prudent travelers should always carry the following:

* **A copy of the original doctor's prescription:** This document should clearly state the patient's name, the medication name (Lorazepam), dosage, and quantity.12  
* **A letter from the prescribing physician:** This letter should be on official letterhead and explain the medical necessity of the medication for the traveler. It should state the patient's full name, the medical condition being treated, and confirm the prescribed dosage.20  
* **Medication in its original packaging:** The Lorazepam should be kept in its original pharmacy bottle with the label intact. The label should clearly show the patient's name, the pharmacy's information, the medication name, and the dosage. Pills should not be consolidated into unmarked containers or daily pill minders.19  
* **Carry-on Luggage:** All medications and the associated documentation must be packed in carry-on luggage, not in checked baggage. This ensures they are accessible for inspection and prevents loss or theft.23

### **Scenario B: Importing More Than 90 mg of Lorazepam**

Travelers needing to import more than 90 mg of Lorazepam, or a supply exceeding one month, are subject to mandatory documentation requirements. These requirements are part of a "dual-trigger" system, where exceeding either the NCD's weight limit or the MHLW's general time limit necessitates specific, and sometimes separate, paperwork.

#### **3.3 The Mandatory Doctor's Certificate**

If a traveler intends to bring **more than 90 mg** of Lorazepam, they are required by the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law* to carry a specific medical certificate from their doctor.2 This is not merely a best practice; it is a legal requirement. The NCD specifies that this certificate must include the following details:

* The patient's full name and current address.  
* The name of the disease or medical condition being treated.  
* A statement confirming the medical necessity of the psychotropic drug for the patient's treatment.  
* A detailed list of the psychotropic medications, including the name (Lorazepam) and the exact quantities (dosage strength and total amount).  
* The original signature of the prescribing doctor.  
* The date the certificate was issued.4

#### **3.4 The *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (Import Certificate): A Separate Requirement**

In addition to the NCD's rules for psychotropics, travelers must also consider the MHLW's general rules for all prescription medications. The MHLW requires travelers to obtain an import certificate, known as a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (or Import Confirmation), if they intend to bring **more than a one-month supply** of any prescription drug into Japan.5

This creates a dual-trigger system for documentation. A traveler must check their supply against both the NCD's 90 mg weight limit and the MHLW's one-month time limit. Exceeding either limit triggers a documentation requirement.

* **Case 1: Over Time Limit, Under Weight Limit.** A traveler needs a 45-day supply of 1 mg Lorazepam tablets (90 tablets total). The total weight is 90×1 mg=90 mg, which is at the NCD limit. However, the 45-day supply exceeds the MHLW's one-month limit. **This traveler needs to apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.**  
* **Case 2: Under Time Limit, Over Weight Limit.** A traveler needs a 25-day supply of 2 mg Lorazepam tablets (50 tablets total). The total weight is 50×2 mg=100 mg, which exceeds the NCD's 90 mg limit. The supply is under the MHLW's one-month limit. **This traveler must carry the NCD-specified doctor's certificate.**  
* **Case 3: Over Both Limits.** A traveler needs a 45-day supply of 2 mg Lorazepam tablets (90 tablets total). The total weight is 90×2 mg=180 mg, which exceeds the NCD's 90 mg limit. The 45-day supply also exceeds the MHLW's one-month limit. **This traveler must carry the NCD-specified doctor's certificate AND apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.**

This analysis demonstrates that travelers cannot assume one rule covers all situations. They must evaluate their specific dosage and trip duration against both thresholds and prepare all required documentation accordingly.

#### **3.5 How to Apply for a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho***

The application process for the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is now primarily handled through an online portal, making it more accessible for international travelers.5

* **Step 1: Access the Online Portal.** The application should be initiated via the MHLW's dedicated "Application for Import Confirmation" website: https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en/.5  
* **Step 2: Prepare Required Documents.** The following documents must be prepared for upload in PDF format 17:  
  * Import Report of Medication (the main application form).  
  * Explanation of Pharmaceutical Product (a separate form for each medication).  
  * A copy of the doctor's prescription or a signed letter of direction. The document must be recent (e.g., issued within the last 6 months) and clearly show the patient's name, medication, and quantity.28  
  * A copy of the flight itinerary or e-ticket that clearly indicates the traveler's arrival date and port of entry.  
* **Step 3: Submit the Application.** The completed application should be submitted online well in advance of the travel date. It is recommended to apply at least two to four weeks prior to departure to allow for processing time.18  
* **Step 4: Receive and Print the Certificate.** Once approved, the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* will be sent to the applicant via email. The traveler must print a hard copy of this certificate and carry it with them. The certificate must be presented to customs officers upon request during the import inspection.9

## **Section 4: Navigating the Japan Customs Declaration**

The final step in the import process is the customs declaration upon arrival in Japan. This stage can be a source of anxiety for travelers carrying controlled medications due to the wording on the declaration form. A careful, risk-averse approach is strongly recommended.

### **4.1 The Customs Declaration Form: An Analysis**

All passengers entering Japan must complete a customs declaration, either using the paper form (C-5360-B) or, more commonly, the electronic version via the "Visit Japan Web" service.23 The critical section of this form contains a series of questions about restricted and prohibited items.

Question 1.1 on the form asks if the traveler is bringing in "Prohibited Articles." The examples provided immediately following the question include: "① Narcotic drugs, stimulants, marijuana, opium, **psychotropic substances**, MDMA, designated drugs".6 As established, Lorazepam is legally classified as a psychotropic substance in Japan.

### **4.2 The Declaration Dilemma: "Yes" or "No"?**

The explicit inclusion of "psychotropic substances" in the list of items to be declared creates a dilemma for travelers carrying Lorazepam, even when their supply is within legal limits.

* **The Argument for Answering "No":** Some travelers and online sources argue that if the medication is legally prescribed, for personal use, and within the permissible quantity limits, it is not truly "prohibited." They interpret the question as targeting illicit drugs and illegal trafficking. Answering "No," they contend, avoids triggering an unnecessary secondary inspection and potential delays.31  
* **The Argument for Answering "Yes":** A literal and legally conservative reading of the form suggests that because Lorazepam is a psychotropic substance, and the form explicitly asks about psychotropic substances, "Yes" is the only factually correct and truthful answer. This approach prioritizes transparency with customs authorities, acknowledging possession of a controlled substance while being prepared to demonstrate its legality.31

From a legal compliance and risk-mitigation perspective, the most prudent course of action is to declare "Yes" on the customs form. The logic supporting this approach is compelling. First, the form's text is unambiguous: it asks about the possession of psychotropic substances, which the traveler factually has.6 Answering "No" could be construed as making a false declaration to a customs official, which is a serious offense in itself, regardless of whether the medication was legally possessed.34 A "Yes" declaration, by contrast, is a truthful statement that initiates a regulated process rather than risking the discovery of an undeclared controlled substance during a random search. Anecdotal reports from travelers who declared "Yes" consistently describe a professional and routine secondary inspection process that, while adding a few minutes to their arrival, carries zero legal risk.31 The potential consequences of a "No" declaration being proven false—detention, prolonged interrogation, confiscation of medication, and possible legal charges—are severe. Therefore, a risk-reward analysis overwhelmingly favors the conservative and truthful approach of declaring "Yes."

### **4.3 The Customs Inspection Experience**

A traveler who declares "Yes" to possessing psychotropic substances should expect to be directed to the "Red Channel" or a secondary inspection area after clearing immigration.31 The process typically unfolds as follows:

1. The traveler presents their declaration (either a QR code from Visit Japan Web or the paper form) to a customs officer.  
2. The officer will note the "Yes" answer and ask the traveler to step aside for a secondary inspection.  
3. At the inspection counter, another officer will ask to see the medication in question and all supporting documentation. This is the point at which the traveler should present their doctor's prescription, the physician's letter, and, if applicable, their *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* or NCD-specified medical certificate.  
4. The officer will verify that the medication in the bottle matches the documentation, that the name on the prescription matches the traveler's passport, and that the quantity is within the legal limits or covered by the appropriate permit.  
5. Provided all paperwork is in order and consistent with the medication being carried, the process is typically concluded professionally and without issue, and the traveler is allowed to proceed.35

## **Section 5: Critical Prohibitions and Final Checklist**

While Lorazepam is permissible under strict conditions, Japan maintains an absolute ban on other substances and methods of import. Adherence to these rules is non-negotiable.

### **5.1 Absolute Prohibitions**

Certain drugs are strictly illegal to bring into Japan under any circumstances, even with a valid prescription from a foreign doctor. Possession of these substances can lead to immediate arrest, detention, and severe criminal penalties.10 These prohibited substances include:

* **Stimulants:** Amphetamines and methamphetamines, including many common medications for ADD/ADHD such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse (which is a stimulant raw material requiring special NCD permission for any amount).10  
* **Products Containing Pseudoephedrine:** Many common over-the-counter cold and sinus medications, such as Sudafed and Vicks inhalers, are prohibited if they contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine.19  
* **Other Illicit Drugs:** Cannabis (marijuana), heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and opium are all strictly prohibited.4

### **5.2 Prohibited Methods of Import**

The rules for personal importation apply only when the medication is physically carried by the person for whom it is prescribed. The following methods of import are strictly forbidden:

* **Import by Mail:** It is illegal to have prescription medications, especially controlled substances like Lorazepam, sent to Japan through international postal or courier services. These packages will be intercepted and seized by customs.4  
* **Import by a Third Party:** A traveler cannot ask another person, including a friend or family member, to carry their prescription medication for them. The medication must be in the possession of the patient named on the prescription.4

### **5.3 Pre-Travel Compliance Checklist**

To ensure a smooth and compliant entry into Japan, travelers carrying Lorazepam should follow this final checklist:

* \[ \] **Identify and Classify:** Confirm your medication is Lorazepam and understand it is a **Psychotropic** substance subject to special rules.  
* \[ \] **Calculate Quantity:** Calculate the total milligram amount of Lorazepam you are bringing using the formula: (number of tablets) × (dosage per tablet).  
* \[ \] **Assess Limits:** Determine if your total quantity is over or under the **90 mg** NCD limit. Separately, determine if your supply is over or under the **one-month** MHLW limit.  
* \[ \] **Gather Documents (Under All Limits):** If under both the 90 mg and one-month limits, obtain a copy of your prescription and a detailed doctor's letter as a best practice.  
* \[ \] **Obtain Mandatory Certificate (Over 90 mg):** If you exceed the 90 mg limit, obtain the mandatory, NCD-specified medical certificate from your doctor.  
* \[ \] **Apply for Permit (Over 1-Month Supply):** If you exceed a one-month supply, apply online for the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* at least 3-4 weeks before your departure.  
* \[ \] **Pack Correctly:** Keep all medication in its original, labeled pharmacy bottle. Place all medication and all supporting documents together in your **carry-on luggage**.  
* \[ \] **Prepare for Declaration:** Be prepared to answer **"Yes"** to the customs declaration question regarding possession of psychotropic substances. Have all your documents organized and ready for a potential secondary inspection.

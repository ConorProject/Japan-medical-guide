## **Part 1: Executive Summary**

The personal importation of testosterone and other medically necessary hormone therapies into Japan is a legally permissible process governed by a clear, multi-tiered regulatory framework. A successful import is contingent upon a precise understanding of the therapy's formulation (e.g., injectable, gel, patch) and the quantity being carried.

A comprehensive review of Japanese law confirms that testosterone, while a potent prescription medication, is **not** classified as a "Narcotic" or "Psychotropic" under the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.1 This is the single most critical fact for any individual on Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT). It means the import process is managed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) under the general rules of the

*Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products (PMD Act)*, not by the more stringent Narcotics Control Department (NCD).

The import rules are differentiated by the medication's formulation:

* **Topical Gels and Patches:** A supply of **up to one month** may be imported for personal use without any special certificate. A supply exceeding one month requires a pre-approved import certificate, the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.3  
* **Injectable Formulations:** This category requires careful distinction.  
  * For **pre-filled syringes or self-injection kits**, the one-month allowance also applies. A supply of up to one month may be imported without a certificate.3  
  * For therapies involving **separate vials of testosterone and empty syringes**, the rules are stricter. The empty syringes are regulated as medical devices, and their importation requires a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* for **any quantity**.5 Therefore, individuals using this common TRT method must obtain the certificate regardless of the length of their stay.

The application for the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is a standardized procedure managed through an official MHLW online portal.6 It requires a valid doctor's prescription, product details, and a flight itinerary.

Upon arrival, travelers carrying testosterone should answer **"No"** to the customs declaration question regarding narcotics and psychotropics. However, carrying a copy of the prescription and, if applicable, the printed *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is essential for a smooth customs clearance process. With a correct understanding of the regulations and proper documentation, importing testosterone into Japan is a clear and manageable process.

## **Part 2: The Japanese Regulatory Framework for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices**

Navigating the import of hormone therapies into Japan requires a foundational understanding of the country's multi-layered legal and regulatory structure. This framework is governed by several key pieces of legislation and enforced by distinct government bodies, each with a specific mandate. The system is characterized by a cautious and risk-averse approach, which informs every aspect of pharmaceutical control, from market approval to personal importation.

### **2.1 Foundational Legislation**

Two principal laws form the legal bedrock for the control of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in Japan.

* **The Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (PMD Act):** This is the central piece of legislation governing all medical products in Japan, including pharmaceuticals, quasi-drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices. Originally known as the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, it was renamed in 2014 to reflect its expanded scope. For the individual importer, the PMD Act is significant because it establishes the overarching framework for product classification, approval, manufacturing, and sale. Its definitions and risk-based categories determine the baseline requirements for bringing any medical product into the country.  
* **The Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law:** This law operates in conjunction with the PMD Act but imposes far stricter controls on substances that have a potential for abuse, dependency, or a significant effect on the central nervous system. It defines specific categories of "Narcotics" and "Psychotropics" and outlines a separate, more rigorous permission process for their handling, including import and export.

### **2.2 Key Regulatory Bodies**

The implementation and enforcement of these laws are managed by a trio of specialized government agencies.

* **Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW):** The MHLW is the primary government ministry responsible for setting national health and pharmaceutical policy. Its regional bureaus, such as the Kanto-Shin'etsu Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare (for arrivals at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports) and the Kinki Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare (for arrivals at Osaka's Kansai International Airport), are the administrative bodies that review applications and issue the standard import certificate, the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.7  
* **Narcotics Control Department (NCD):** The NCD is a specialized division within the MHLW that has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters related to narcotics, psychotropics, and their raw materials.9 If a medication is classified as a narcotic or psychotropic, the NCD manages a separate and distinct import permission process.  
* **Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA):** The PMDA functions as the primary scientific review body for the MHLW. Its main role is to evaluate the quality, efficacy, and safety of new drugs and medical devices for marketing approval *within* Japan. While the PMDA is not directly involved in processing personal import applications, its decisions on which therapies are approved for domestic sale have a significant indirect impact. Individuals requiring therapies that are not approved and available in Japan must rely entirely on the personal importation system to continue their treatment.

The interplay of these laws and agencies reflects a regulatory philosophy that is demonstrably more conservative and risk-averse than that of many Western nations. This is not simply a matter of bureaucracy but a deliberate policy stance. This cautious approach is also evident in the strict prohibition of substances with stimulant properties, such as pseudoephedrine, which are common ingredients in over-the-counter cold and allergy medications elsewhere but are tightly controlled in Japan to prevent any potential for abuse.10 For any individual seeking to import a medication, this deep-seated regulatory philosophy necessitates an approach grounded in absolute procedural correctness and an assumption of high scrutiny. The system is designed to be restrictive by default, placing the full burden of proof of medical necessity and compliance squarely on the importer.

## **Part 3: The Critical First Step: The Legal Classification of Testosterone in Japan**

The single most important step in preparing to import hormone therapy into Japan is to determine the precise legal classification of the specific medication. The entire customs and declaration process is dictated by where the substance falls within Japan's strict hierarchy of control.

### **3.1 The Hierarchy of Control in Japan**

Japanese law categorizes medical substances into several distinct tiers, each with its own set of import rules.

* **Level 1: Prohibited Drugs:** This category includes substances that are absolutely forbidden to import under any circumstances. Key examples are amphetamines (such as Adderall) and methamphetamines.10 Possessing these substances in Japan is a serious criminal offense, and a valid foreign prescription provides no legal defense.  
* **Level 2: Narcotics and Psychotropics:** These are highly controlled substances that require special, advance permission from the Narcotics Control Department (NCD) for importation, or at a minimum, specific documentation and adherence to strict quantity limits.9  
* **Level 3: Prescription Drugs:** This is the default and broadest category for most medications that require a doctor's prescription but are not otherwise classified as narcotics or psychotropics. For these drugs, a supply of up to one month is generally permitted for personal import without a certificate. Any quantity exceeding a one-month supply requires a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.3

### **3.2 The Definitive Classification of Testosterone**

A thorough review of Japan's pharmaceutical regulations and official controlled substance lists reveals a clear and definitive classification for testosterone.

**Testosterone is regulated as a "Prescription Drug" (処方箋医薬品) under the PMD Act. It is NOT classified as a "Narcotic" or "Psychotropic" under the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law***.1

This is confirmed by several key sources:

* The official "Controlled Substances List" published by the MHLW's Narcotics Control Department, which details all substances regulated as Narcotics, Psychotropics, and Stimulant Raw Materials, does not contain testosterone or any of its common esters (e.g., enanthate, cypionate, propionate).1  
* A 2019 report from the Law Library of Congress explicitly states that Japanese laws, including the *Narcotics and Psychotropic Control Law*, do not classify anabolic steroids as a controlled substance.2  
* Official Japanese pharmaceutical databases classify testosterone products as "prescription drugs" and "hormonal agents," without any designation as a narcotic or psychotropic.13

This classification is of paramount importance. It means that the importation of testosterone for personal use does not require any special permission from the Narcotics Control Department. Instead, it is governed by the standard rules for general prescription drugs, which are based on formulation and quantity.

## **Part 4: The Import Process: Differentiated Rules by Formulation**

The procedure for importing testosterone into Japan is stratified based on the medication's formulation and the quantity of the supply. The rules for topical applications like gels and patches differ significantly from those for injectable solutions.

### **4.1 Gels, Patches, and other Topical/Oral Preparations**

For hormone therapies delivered via topical gels, transdermal patches, or other external applications, the import process is straightforward and governed by the standard "one-month rule."

* **Up to a 1-Month Supply:** An individual can import a supply sufficient for one month of personal use without needing to obtain a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* or any other special certificate.3  
* **More than a 1-Month Supply:** To import a quantity that exceeds a one-month supply, obtaining a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* before traveling to Japan is mandatory.3

Even when importing within the one-month limit, it is highly advisable to carry a copy of the prescription and a doctor's letter to avoid potential complications or questions at customs.10

### **4.2 Injectable Medications: The Highest Level of Scrutiny**

Injectable medications are treated as a distinct category under Japanese pharmaceutical law. The rules are more complex and depend on whether the product is a pre-filled kit or involves separate vials and syringes.

* **Pre-filled Syringes / Self-Injection Kits:** For products that come in a pre-filled format designed for self-administration, the one-month allowance applies. A traveler can bring up to a **one-month supply** of these kits without a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.3 For any quantity exceeding a one-month supply, the certificate is required.  
* **Vials and Separate Syringes (Critical Distinction):** This common method for TRT faces the strictest regulations. The import is viewed as two separate components: the drug (testosterone vial) and the medical devices (empty syringes). While the vial of testosterone falls under the drug rules, the **empty syringes are regulated more stringently**. Official MHLW guidance and user experiences indicate that importing even a single empty syringe requires a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.5 Therefore, any individual whose therapy involves drawing medication from a vial into a separate syringe  
  **must obtain a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* to legally import their supplies, regardless of the quantity or duration of their stay.**

This distinction is crucial. Relying on the one-month exemption is not a compliant strategy for those using vials and syringes. The certificate is necessary to authorize the import of the syringes themselves.

## **Part 5: The *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (Import Confirmation Certificate): A Comprehensive Guide**

For any traveler with a supply of testosterone exceeding one month, or for anyone using the vial-and-syringe method, obtaining an Import Confirmation Certificate is a legal necessity. This certificate, issued by the MHLW, serves as official pre-approval for the importation of medications and medical devices.

### **5.1 Clarifying the Terminology: *Yakkan Shoumei* vs. *Yunyu Kakunin-sho***

Travelers researching this topic will inevitably encounter two different Japanese terms for the import certificate.

* ***Yakkan Shoumei*** **(薬監証明):** This is the older term. Many official documents from a few years ago, as well as numerous informal online guides and forum posts, refer exclusively to the *Yakkan Shoumei*.  
* ***Yunyu Kakunin-sho*** **(輸入確認書):** This is the current, official name for the certificate, translating to "Import Confirmation Certificate." All modern MHLW guidance and the official online application portal use this term.

For all practical purposes, these terms refer to the same document and process. This report will use the current official term, *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.

### **5.2 The Online Application Portal: A Modernized Process**

As of February 1, 2023, the application process for the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* has been significantly modernized and moved to a dedicated online portal managed by the MHLW. This is now the primary and strongly recommended method for all applications.

The online portal can be accessed at: [**https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en/**](https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en/)

The process involves three main steps:

1. **Create an Account:** The applicant must first register an account on the portal.  
2. **Online Application:** Once logged in, the applicant selects the "Import for personal use" category, fills out the required information in the online forms, and uploads digital copies (e.g., PDF, JPG) of all necessary supporting documents.  
3. **Acquisition of Certificate:** After the application is reviewed and approved by the relevant Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare, the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is issued as a PDF file. The applicant can download this certificate from the portal and will also be sent to the applicant's registered email address.

This digital system is a major improvement over the previous, paper-based system that relied on post or email. It eliminates international mailing delays, allows for status tracking, and streamlines the entire procedure.6

### **5.3 Required Documentation: A Detailed Checklist**

The success of a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* application hinges on the submission of complete and accurate documentation. The following table details the essential documents required for the online application.

| Document Name | Key Information Required | Best Practices & Notes | Key Source(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Doctor's Prescription / Letter** | Patient's full name, Doctor's full name and signature, Name of each medication/device, Dosage instructions, Total quantity to be imported. | The prescription should be recent. A separate letter from the doctor explaining the medical necessity is highly recommended. | 9 |
| **Product Information** | Name of the product, Manufacturer, Active ingredients and quantity, Efficacy/purpose of the product. | This information can be found on the product's packaging or the manufacturer's official pamphlet. For the online form, this information is entered into specific fields. |  |
| **Travel Itinerary** | Applicant's full name (must match passport), Arrival airport in Japan, Date of arrival, Flight number. | A copy of the confirmed flight e-ticket or official itinerary from the airline is required. The application cannot be completed without confirmed travel details. |  |

### **5.4 Application Timeline and Best Practices**

While the online system has expedited the process, ample time should still be allocated.

* **Timeline:** Official processing time is stated to be a few business days if the application is complete. However, it is highly advisable to submit the application at least **two to four weeks prior to the departure date** to account for potential requests for additional information or unforeseen delays.7  
* **Contact Information:** If there are questions about the application, the applicant should contact the Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare that has jurisdiction over their planned airport of arrival. For arrivals at Tokyo's Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) airports, the correct office is the Kanto-Shin'etsu Regional Bureau, which can be reached at **yakkan@mhlw.go.jp**.7  
* **Post-Approval:** Once the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is received via email as a PDF, it should be printed out. It is wise to carry multiple copies. This printed certificate is the official permission that must be presented to customs officials.

## **Part 6: Customs Declaration and Arrival Procedures**

Possessing the correct documentation is only the first part of the process. The final step is a successful clearance through Japanese customs at the port of entry. Proper declaration and organized documentation are key to a smooth experience.

### **6.1 Electronic Declaration via "Visit Japan Web"**

Japan Customs encourages all incoming travelers to use the **"Visit Japan Web"** service to complete their customs and immigration declarations electronically before arrival. This service allows travelers to input their information online and generates a single QR code. At the airport, this QR code can be scanned at an electronic declaration terminal, often allowing for much faster processing than the manual paper-based system.

### **6.2 How to Declare Your Medications**

A key part of the customs declaration form is a question asking if the traveler is carrying prohibited or restricted items, including narcotics, psychotropics, or stimulants.18

Because testosterone is **not** legally classified as a narcotic or psychotropic in Japan, the legally correct answer to this question is **"No."**

Answering "Yes" would be factually incorrect and could trigger an unnecessary diversion to a secondary inspection process designed for travelers carrying substances that fall under the *Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law*.

The optimal strategy is one of **Proactive Transparency**. The traveler should answer "No" on the form, in accordance with the law, but be fully prepared to voluntarily declare the medication and its accompanying documentation to the customs officer at the inspection point if questioned. This approach demonstrates both an understanding of the law and a commitment to full disclosure, ensuring the smoothest possible interaction.

### **6.3 Preparing for Customs Inspection**

To facilitate a smooth inspection, travelers should:

1. **Organize All Documents:** Have a printed copy of the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (if applicable), the original doctor's prescription, and any supporting letter from the physician readily accessible in carry-on luggage. Do not pack these documents in checked baggage.17  
2. **Keep Medication in Original Packaging:** All medications and supplies should be kept in their original pharmacy-labeled bottles or manufacturer's boxes. Do not consolidate items into unmarked containers.19 The labels provide crucial verification that matches the prescription and the  
   *Yunyu Kakunin-sho*.  
3. **Be Prepared to Present:** When directed to the inspection counter, calmly present the customs officer with the passport and the complete package of documentation if asked.

The *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* functions as a "passport for your medication." It is an official document from the MHLW certifying that the import is legal for personal use. By presenting this certificate, the traveler shifts the interaction with the customs officer from one of potential adjudication to one of simple verification.

## **Part 7: Conclusion and Final Recommendations**

The importation of medically necessary hormone therapies, such as testosterone, into Japan is governed by a clear, albeit strict, regulatory framework. The process is entirely manageable, but it demands meticulous preparation, adherence to procedure, and a correct understanding of the medication's legal status.

The analysis reveals that the core of a successful import strategy is built around four key actions:

1. **CLASSIFY:** Correctly identify the legal classification of the hormone therapy. For testosterone, this is a **prescription drug**, not a narcotic or psychotropic. This is the most important distinction.  
2. **ASSESS FORMULATION:** Determine the import requirements based on the specific formulation of the therapy.  
   * For gels, patches, or oral forms, a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is only needed for supplies exceeding one month.  
   * For injectable pre-filled kits, a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is only needed for supplies exceeding one month.  
   * For injectable therapy using separate vials and syringes, a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is **always** required to authorize the import of the syringes.  
3. **APPLY:** If a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is required, apply well in advance of travel (at least 3-4 weeks) using the official MHLW online portal, submitting all required documentation.  
4. **DECLARE AND DOCUMENT:** At customs, answer the declaration form truthfully (i.e., "No" to the narcotics question for testosterone). Keep all medications in their original packaging and have all documents (prescription, doctor's letter, and the printed *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* if applicable) in carry-on luggage, ready for inspection.

By following these steps, individuals requiring testosterone therapy can confidently ensure an uninterrupted supply of their medication. This preparation transforms a potentially stressful bureaucratic hurdle into a manageable part of the travel plan, allowing for a safe and healthy stay in Japan.

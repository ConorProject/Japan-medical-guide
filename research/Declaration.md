The Japanese Customs Declaration Form: It Does Not Explicitly Ask About Medicines

The standard Japanese Customs Declaration Form (paper version) does not include a checkbox labeled “medications” or “prescription drugs.” This omission creates confusion for travelers carrying legitimate, regulated medicine — especially injectables like EpiPens or TRT syringes.

Instead, the form typically includes broader, vague categories like:

❓ “Are you bringing any of the following items into Japan?”
	•	Narcotics or other drugs
	•	Firearms, explosives
	•	Goods exceeding duty-free limits
	•	Commercial goods

🟥 There is no specific checkbox for “medications,” “medical devices,” or “prescription drugs.”

🔍 So What Should You Do?

✅ 1. Use the Red Channel if carrying injectable medication

Even if there’s no clear checkbox, the Red Channel is for “items to declare.” Prescription injectables, hormone treatments, or drug-device combinations (like a TRT syringe) fall under this.

You may be asked:
	•	“Do you have anything to declare?”
	•	“Are you carrying any medicines?”

Say yes, and explain you are carrying a prescription injectable for personal medical use.

✅ 2. If Using Visit Japan Web, the Digital Form Does Ask

The digital customs form on Visit Japan Web does include:

“Are you bringing any medications, medical devices, or other items that may require declaration?”

✅ Check “Yes” here — it will flag your entry for possible customs inspection, and instruct you to go through the Red Channel.

🧠 Why Declare, Even If the Paper Form Doesn’t Ask?

Because under Customs Law Article 68, travelers are legally obligated to declare any regulated goods, including:
	•	Medications requiring prescription in Japan,
	•	Injectables,
	•	Hormone-based substances,
	•	Self-injection devices.

If you do not declare, and the item is flagged during inspection (e.g. scanner, random bag check), it can be treated as a false declaration or attempt to conceal a regulated item — even if your intent was innocent.

# **A Definitive Guide for Tourists: Navigating the Personal Import of EpiPens into Japan**

## **Section 1: Executive Summary & At-a-Glance Guide**

The process of bringing personal medication into Japan is governed by a strict regulatory framework that can appear complex and, at times, contradictory to international visitors. For tourists who rely on an epinephrine auto-injector, such as an EpiPen, for life-threatening allergies, understanding these regulations is not merely a matter of compliance but of personal safety. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the current rules and procedures, synthesizing official government information with practical clarifications to offer a definitive guide.

The core finding of this analysis is that a tourist can, under normal circumstances, bring a limited quantity of EpiPens into Japan for personal use without obtaining prior approval. The key is understanding the specific quantity limits and preparing the correct documentation. The primary certificate required for importing medication in quantities that exceed personal allowances is the ***Yunyu Kakunin-sho*** **(YKS)**, which translates to an "Import of Medication Certification".1 Travelers may encounter older online resources referring to this document by its former name,

*Yakkan Shoumei*.2 Both terms refer to the same certificate, but

*Yunyu Kakunin-sho* is the current, official designation.

To provide immediate clarity, the following table outlines the necessary actions based on the number of EpiPens a tourist intends to bring into Japan.

| Number of EpiPens | *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (YKS) Required? | Key Actions & Required Documents |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1 or 2** | **No** | 1\. Keep EpiPens in their original, labeled packaging. 2\. Carry a copy of your doctor's prescription. 3\. Carry a detailed Doctor's Letter of Necessity. 4\. Declare the items at customs upon arrival. |
| **3 or more** | **Yes** | 1\. Complete all actions listed for 1-2 EpiPens. 2\. Apply for and receive the YKS certificate before traveling to Japan. 3\. Carry a printed copy of the approved YKS. 4\. Present the YKS to the customs officer upon declaration. |

This guide will proceed to unpack the legal framework, analyze the specific classification of the EpiPen under Japanese law, provide a step-by-step guide for the YKS application if needed, detail the customs declaration process, and offer best practices for pre-travel preparation and in-country medical readiness.

## **Section 2: The Regulatory Landscape: Understanding Japan's Import Laws**

To navigate the import process successfully, it is essential to understand the legal and administrative structure that governs it. The personal importation of all medical products into Japan is primarily controlled by two key pieces of legislation: the *Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices* (often referred to by its former name, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law) and the *Customs Law*.5 The stated purpose of these laws is to protect public health by preventing the circulation of unapproved, defective, or counterfeit medical products and to control the entry of potentially harmful substances.3

Three government bodies are central to this process, each with a distinct role:

* **Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW):** This is the principal regulatory authority. The MHLW sets the rules for which medications and medical devices can be imported, defines the quantity limits for personal use, and is the agency responsible for processing applications for and issuing the *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (YKS).1  
* **Japan Customs:** This is the enforcement agency at all ports of entry. Customs officers inspect travelers' belongings and documentation to ensure compliance with the regulations established by the MHLW.6 They have the authority to confiscate items that do not meet import requirements.  
* **Narcotics Control Department (NCD):** A specialized division within the MHLW, the NCD manages a separate and significantly more stringent import process for substances classified as narcotics (e.g., morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone), psychotropics, and stimulants' raw materials.3

A foundational point of clarity for any traveler carrying an EpiPen is that their medication does **not** fall under the purview of the Narcotics Control Department. Epinephrine, the active ingredient in an EpiPen, is not classified as a narcotic, psychotropic, or controlled stimulant under Japanese law.10 This distinction is critical. Many travelers are aware of Japan's famously strict, zero-tolerance policy towards illegal drugs and may incorrectly assume that all prescription medications are subject to the most severe level of scrutiny. However, the regulatory system is bifurcated. There is a highly restrictive, permission-based path for narcotics managed by the NCD, and a separate, more straightforward process for general prescription drugs and medical devices managed by the regional Bureaus of Health and Welfare through the YKS system.8 By understanding that the EpiPen follows this general path, travelers can correctly focus their preparation efforts on the relevant regulations and avoid the unnecessary anxiety associated with the rules for narcotics.

## **Section 3: The EpiPen Classification: A Detailed Analysis**

One of the primary sources of confusion for travelers is the EpiPen's dual nature: it is simultaneously an injectable drug (epinephrine) and a medical device (the auto-injector mechanism). Japanese regulations have distinct rules for each category, and understanding how they intersect and are practically applied is key to confident compliance.

An examination of the official rules published by the MHLW and Japan Customs reveals two relevant quantity limits for items brought in without a YKS:

1. **As an Injectable Drug:** The regulations permit the import of an "Injectable drug and Syringe for the drug" for up to a **"1 month supply"** without a YKS, with the important condition that it must be a **"Pre-filled Syringe" or "Self-injection Kit"**.3 This description perfectly matches the form and function of an EpiPen.  
2. **As a Medical Device:** The rules also state that a "Medical device for household use" is limited to **"1 set"** without a YKS.4 If interpreted in isolation, this rule could be misconstrued as permitting only a single auto-injector, creating a direct conflict with the allowance for a "1 month supply" of the injectable drug it contains.

This apparent contradiction is resolved by applying the more specific rule and understanding the practical interpretation of "supply" for an emergency medication. The MHLW's category of "Pre-filled Syringe" or "Self-injection Kit" is far more specific to the EpiPen than the generic "Medical device for household use" category. Therefore, the "1 month supply" rule for the injectable drug component takes precedence.

The challenge then becomes defining a "1 month supply" for a medication that is not taken on a regular schedule. An EpiPen is carried for a potential, unscheduled life-threatening emergency. In this context, the concept of a daily or weekly dosage is meaningless. The interpretation of a reasonable supply must instead be based on risk management for the duration of a trip. Global medical best practice for individuals with severe allergies, and the standard of care recommended by allergist associations, is to carry two epinephrine auto-injectors at all times. This is to account for the possibility of a device misfire, user error, or the occurrence of a biphasic reaction, where symptoms recur hours after the initial anaphylactic event.

This medical standard appears to form the basis of the MHLW's practical enforcement. While not explicitly codified in the public-facing regulations, anecdotal reports from numerous travelers who have contacted the MHLW's regional bureaus directly via email consistently receive the same guidance: a tourist may bring **two EpiPens** into Japan without needing to apply for a YKS.16 This "2-pen rule" is not an unsubstantiated rumor but the MHLW's pragmatic interpretation of the "1 month supply" rule as it applies to the unique case of an emergency auto-injector.

Therefore, the definitive recommendation is as follows: A traveler carrying one or two EpiPens is operating within the personal import exemption and does not need a YKS. A traveler who must carry three or more EpiPens for their trip is required to obtain a YKS before departure.

## **Section 4: The Yunyu Kakunin-sho (Import Certificate): A Step-by-Step Procedural Guide**

For travelers who need to bring three or more EpiPens, or who are carrying other prescription medications in quantities exceeding a one-month supply, applying for and receiving a *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (YKS) is mandatory.4 This certificate must be obtained

*before* leaving for Japan and presented to customs upon arrival.

### **4.1 When to Apply**

A YKS is required under the following circumstances:

* Importing **three or more** EpiPen auto-injectors.  
* Importing more than a **one-month supply** of any other prescription medication.  
* Importing more than a **two-month supply** of non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicine.12  
* Importing certain medical devices, such as a CPAP machine, or more than one of other devices like asthma inhalers.4

### **4.2 The Modern Application Process**

It is crucial for travelers to be aware that the YKS application process has been modernized. Older guides and forum posts may describe a cumbersome process of submitting physical documents by international mail.18 This information is obsolete. The MHLW has implemented a dedicated online portal for these applications, which is now the standard method.1

The official MHLW online portal can be accessed at: https://impconf.mhlw.go.jp/aicpte/page/login.jsp?lang=en.1

The process involves creating a user account and then initiating a new application. Applicants should be aware that they will need to have their flight information, including arrival airport and date, to complete the online forms.1

### **4.3 Required Documentation Checklist**

A successful application depends on submitting a complete and accurate set of documents through the online portal. The following table details the required components.

| Required Document | Official Japanese Name | Description & Key Details |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Import Report of Medication** | 輸入報告書 (Yunyu Hokokusho) | This is the main application form, which is filled out directly within the online portal. It requires personal details, travel information, and a list of the items to be imported.4 |
| **Explanation of Product** | 商品説明書 (Shohin Setsumeisho) | For each medication or device, this document must detail the product name (e.g., EpiPen), active ingredient (e.g., Epinephrine), dosage, and the total quantity you wish to import. A manufacturer's product information leaflet or a clear photo of the product packaging showing this information is often sufficient.4 |
| **Copy of Prescription** | 処方せんの写し (Shohosen no Utsushi) | A clear, legible copy of the original doctor's prescription for the medication. The patient's name, medication details, and prescribing doctor's information must be visible and must match the details provided in the other application documents.4 |
| **Flight Itinerary** | 旅程表 (Ryoteihyo) | A document proving your travel plans, such as a copy of your e-ticket or an itinerary from a travel agent. This must clearly show your full name, arrival date, flight number, and port of entry into Japan.1 |

### **4.4 Timelines, Approval, and Use**

Travelers should plan well in advance. It is strongly recommended to submit the YKS application **at least one month before the scheduled departure date**. Processing can take several weeks, and this buffer allows time for any potential queries from the MHLW or resubmission of documents if needed.1

Once the application is reviewed and approved by the MHLW pharmaceutical inspector, the official YKS certificate will be sent to the applicant via email. The traveler must **print a physical copy** of this certificate and carry it with them. It is crucial to verify that all details on the certificate are correct. The YKS is only valid for the exact products and quantities listed; any discrepancies, such as carrying a different medication or a larger quantity, will render the certificate invalid.4

## **Section 5: Arrival in Japan: The Customs Declaration Process**

Upon arrival in Japan, all travelers must complete a customs declaration. This is the final and most critical step in the import process, where all prior preparation is put into practice.

### **5.1 The Declaration Form: Paper vs. Digital**

Travelers have two options for completing their customs declaration:

1. **Paper Form:** The traditional method involves filling out the "Declaration of Accompanied Articles and Unaccompanied Articles" (Form C-5360-B is the English version). These forms are typically distributed on inbound international flights or are available in the customs hall upon arrival.20  
2. **Digital Form (Recommended):** The modern, streamlined method is to use the **"Visit Japan Web"** service. This official government platform allows travelers to complete their immigration and customs declarations online before their trip. Upon completion, the system generates a QR code. At the airport, this QR code can be scanned at an electronic customs declaration terminal, allowing for a faster and smoother passage through customs.23

### **5.2 Field-by-Field Instructions for Declaration**

A significant point of confusion arises from the design of the customs declaration form itself, which has no specific box or question for "prescription medication." The most relevant question is 1.1 on Side A, which asks if the traveler is bringing in "Narcotic drugs, Firearms, Explosives and other Prohibited item(s)".22

While an EpiPen is not a narcotic and is not prohibited when carried for personal use in appropriate quantities, it is a potent prescription injectable and a restricted item. The most compliant and risk-averse strategy is to **proactively declare the item**. A "No" answer, while technically correct in a narrow sense, risks a customs officer discovering the undeclared injectable during a routine baggage search. This could lead to lengthy questioning, suspicion, and potential confiscation.

Conversely, a "Yes" answer is an act of transparent disclosure. It signals to the officer, "I am carrying a restricted medical item that I believe requires declaration." This approach transforms a moment of potential conflict into one of cooperative compliance. It allows the traveler to take control of the interaction by immediately presenting their well-prepared documentation. The following table provides a clear guide for this strategy.

| Form Section | Question / Field | Recommended Action | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Side A** | **Question 1.1:** "Are you bringing... Narcotic drugs... or other Prohibited item(s)?" | **Check "Yes"** | To proactively and transparently declare a restricted prescription medical item. |
| **Side B** | **"Description of other goods"** | Write: **"Epinephrine Auto-Injector (EpiPen) for personal medical use"** | To provide a clear, specific description of the declared item. |
| **Side B** | **"Quantity"** | Write the number of pens (e.g., "2"). | To accurately state the quantity being imported. |

### **5.3 At the Customs Inspection Point**

Having checked "Yes" on the declaration form, travelers should proceed to the **"Red Channel" (Goods to Declare)** at the customs inspection area.9 It is essential to have the following items readily accessible in carry-on luggage, not packed away in checked baggage:

* The EpiPen(s) in their original packaging.  
* The "Essential Document Portfolio" (detailed in the next section), including the doctor's letter and prescription.  
* The printed *Yunyu Kakunin-sho* (YKS), if one was required and obtained.

At the red channel inspection counter, the traveler should present their passport and completed declaration form (or QR code) to the customs officer. When asked about the declared items, they can present the EpiPens and the supporting documentation. If a YKS was obtained, it is mandatory to present it at this stage.2 This prepared and transparent approach is the most effective way to ensure a smooth and efficient customs clearance.

## **Section 6: Pre-Travel Preparations and Best Practices**

Thorough preparation before departure is the most effective way to mitigate risk and ensure a stress-free entry into Japan. This involves assembling a comprehensive set of documents and adhering to best practices for packing and transport.

### **6.1 Assembling Your "Essential Document Portfolio"**

Travelers should create a dedicated physical or digital file containing all medical paperwork. The centerpiece of this portfolio is a detailed letter from the prescribing physician. While a simple prescription copy is a baseline requirement, a "Gold Standard" doctor's letter provides an unparalleled level of assurance. The most effective letter is one that is modeled on the highly stringent documentation requirements that Japan's Narcotics Control Department (NCD) specifies for the import of controlled substances.10 While an EpiPen is not a narcotic, preparing a document that meets this higher standard demonstrates exceptional diligence and preempts nearly any question a customs officer might have. This approach of "over-compliance" builds immediate credibility.

A "Gold Standard" doctor's letter should be on official letterhead and include the following details:

* **Patient Information:** The traveler's full legal name and date of birth.  
* **Diagnosis:** The specific name of the medical condition (e.g., "Severe Anaphylaxis to Peanuts and Tree Nuts").  
* **Statement of Medical Necessity:** A clear and unambiguous statement explaining why it is medically essential for the patient to carry the epinephrine auto-injector at all times for emergency self-administration.  
* **Medication Details:** A precise list of the medication being carried, including:  
  * Product Name: EpiPen (or other brand)  
  * Active Ingredient: Epinephrine  
  * Dosage: (e.g., 0.3 mg)  
  * Quantity: The exact number of auto-injectors being carried.  
* **Prescribing Doctor's Information:** The doctor's full name, medical facility address, telephone number, and official signature or stamp.  
* **Date of Issue:** The letter should be dated reasonably close to the travel dates.

This portfolio should also include a copy of the actual pharmacy prescription and, if a YKS was obtained, the printed certificate.

### **6.2 Packaging and In-Flight Transport**

How the medication is packed and transported is as important as the documentation.

* **Original Packaging is Non-Negotiable:** EpiPens must be kept in their original, pharmacy-labeled boxes or tubes.4 Do not transfer them to a generic pouch, pill organizer, or any unmarked container. The official labeling connects the device to the prescription and the traveler.  
* **Carry-On Luggage Only:** Under no circumstances should EpiPens be placed in checked baggage. They must be carried in the cabin with the traveler.26 This prevents loss from mishandled luggage and protects the medication from the extreme temperature fluctuations in the cargo hold, which can degrade the epinephrine and render the device ineffective.  
* **Airline Security:** When passing through airport security, travelers should inform the security officers that they are carrying a medical auto-injector. Having the doctor's letter readily available can help explain the item and expedite the screening process.26

## **Section 7: In-Country Medical Preparedness**

While proper import procedures are vital, a traveler's medical preparedness should extend to their time within Japan.

### **Emergency Procedures in Japan**

In the event of a medical emergency requiring an ambulance, the nationwide emergency number in Japan is **119**.27

Communication during a crisis can be difficult. It is highly recommended that travelers with severe allergies follow the advice of organizations like Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) and prepare a **bilingual (Japanese/English) emergency card**.27 This card should clearly state in both languages:

* The specific allergy (e.g., "Life-threatening peanut allergy").  
* The key symptoms of anaphylaxis.  
* Instructions on when and how to administer the EpiPen.  
* A request to call 119 for an ambulance immediately after administration.

This simple tool can overcome language barriers and ensure that first responders or bystanders understand the situation and can provide appropriate help quickly.

### **Obtaining a Replacement EpiPen in Japan**

It is important for travelers to understand that **foreign prescriptions are not honored in Japanese pharmacies**.12 If an EpiPen is lost, used, or expires during the trip, a traveler cannot simply buy a replacement with their home country's prescription.

To obtain a new EpiPen, the traveler must:

1. **See a Japanese Doctor:** Visit a local medical clinic or hospital to be assessed by a licensed Japanese physician. Seeking out an allergist (*arerugī-ka* アレルギー科) is ideal.17  
2. **Receive a Japanese Prescription:** The doctor will issue a new prescription valid in Japan.  
3. **Purchase from a Japanese Pharmacy:** The prescription can then be filled at a local pharmacy.

EpiPens are available in Japan, so sourcing a replacement is possible.17 However, for a tourist without Japanese national health insurance, this will be an out-of-pocket expense. It is therefore highly advisable to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers emergency medical care and prescription costs.27 For assistance in finding English-speaking medical facilities, resources like the

**AMDA International Medical Information Center** can be invaluable.27

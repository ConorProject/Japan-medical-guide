## 1. Official Government FAQs and Supporting Documents

### Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) - Primary Sources

**Key Finding from NCD (Narcotics Control Department):**
> "Amphetamine (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient of ADDERALL) is controlled as 'Stimulants' under the Stimulants Control Act, and **cannot be imported into Japan, even for treatment purposes**."

**Source:** https://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/en/application2.html

### Import/Export Application Documentation

The official MHLW documentation reveals a crucial distinction:
- **Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine):** Listed as "Stimulants' Raw Materials" - **CAN be imported with advance permit**
- **Adderall (Amphetamine):** Listed as "Stimulants" - **CANNOT be imported under any circumstances**

This distinction is critical - it shows Japan's nuanced approach where some ADHD medications can be legally imported with proper procedures, while others are completely prohibited.

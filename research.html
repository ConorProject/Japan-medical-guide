            <h1>Our Research Process</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">How we obtained official clarification on Japan's medication import regulations</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Investigation</h2>
            <p>Faced with contradictory information about Japan's medication import requirements, it became clear that secondary sources were insufficient. The apparent contradictions between different agencies' requirements needed official clarification. Direct contact with both the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and Tokyo Customs was necessary.</p>

            <div class="correspondence">
                <p>Our direct correspondence with Tokyo Customs clarified the declaration requirements:</p>
                <blockquote>
                "Regardless of the quantity of psychotropic substances brought in, please declare them by marking Yes to question 1.① of the CUSTOMS DECLARATION... Please proceed to the (manned) customs inspection desk... We, Customs would like travelers to bring a document that shows the prescription information."
                </blockquote>
                <cite>Customs Counselor's Office, Tokyo Customs</cite>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This requirement makes perfect sense when you understand the regulatory framework. Psychotropic substances must be declared because they're prohibited substances. However, customs needs to verify that the traveler qualifies for the exception. The prescription documentation proves the medication was prescribed for that specific patient, satisfying the narrow exception that makes import legal.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This correspondence clarified what had been opaque: customs declaration requirements operate independently of MHLW's permit system. Medications appear on customs declaration forms based on their regulatory sensitivity, not solely on quantity-based permit requirements. A medication can be "permitted" by the MHLW while simultaneously requiring mandatory declaration by Customs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Declaration Requirement Logic</h2>
            <p>The official customs declaration form that every traveler must complete reveals the logic behind border procedures. Question 1(1) asks travelers to declare: "Narcotic drugs, Firearms, Explosives and other Prohibited item(s)." The form specifically lists "narcotic drugs, stimulants, marijuana, opium, psychotropic substances, MDMA, designated drugs" as items requiring declaration.</p>
            
            <p>This creates apparent contradictions that confuse travelers. A person taking clonazepam for anxiety finds their medication listed alongside "narcotic drugs" and "MDMA" on the customs form, suggesting it's prohibited. Yet MHLW guidance indicates that prescribed psychotropics can be imported legally.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't a contradiction—it's the system working as designed. Psychotropic medications are prohibited substances, but travelers can qualify for a narrow exception if the medication is prescribed for them personally. Customs needs to verify at the border that anyone carrying these substances meets the appropriate requirements.</p>

            <h3>The Critical Distinction</h3>
            <p>The regulatory complexity deepens when examining the official MHLW psychotropic substances list. Japan's definition of "psychotropic substances" is specific and limited to medications appearing on their official controlled list, creating an important distinction that most guidance overlooks: <strong>medications on the MHLW psychotropic substances list versus medications not on the list.</strong></p>
            
            <p>When travelers read that "SSRIs are psychotropic" in medical literature and "psychotropic substances require special procedures" in travel guidance, they naturally assume special procedures are necessary. However, most SSRIs do not appear on Japan's official psychotropic substances list, requiring only standard Green Channel procedures. The key insight is that Japan's regulatory definition refers specifically to medications on their official controlled list, not the broader medical definition of medications affecting brain chemistry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Classification Framework</h2>
            <p>Based on our official correspondence and analysis of both regulatory frameworks, we developed a classification system that reflects what travelers actually encounter:</p>

            <div class="classification">
                <h4>Prohibited</h4>
                <p>Substances that cannot enter Japan under any circumstances. These are illegal under Japanese law with no exceptions for personal medical use. Examples include amphetamine-based medications and pseudoephedrine-containing products.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="classification">
                <h4>Restricted</h4>
                <p>Medications requiring specific action at the customs desk. This includes substances requiring advance import permits, as well as substances on the MHLW psychotropic list (regardless of quantity) which must be declared at the Red Channel with prescription documentation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="classification">
                <h4>Permitted</h4>
                <p>Medications not appearing on controlled substance lists that can proceed through the Green Channel with original packaging and prescription documentation. This includes most SSRIs, standard antibiotics, and common medications that do not appear on Japan's official psychotropic substances list.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Detailed Research Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our classification system draws from multiple official sources to ensure comprehensive accuracy. Rather than relying on interpretations or assumptions, we obtained official confirmation of declaration procedures and their relationship to MHLW import regulations.</p>

            <div class="methodology">
                <h3>Primary Sources</h3>
                <p>Direct correspondence with Tokyo Customs confirming declaration requirements for substances on the MHLW psychotropic list.</p>
                <p>Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare official psychotropic substances list with specific quantity thresholds for medications requiring import permits.</p>
                <p>Cross-verification ensuring each medication classification reflects both MHLW list status and customs declaration obligations as confirmed through official channels.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Confusion Persists</h2>
            <p>Much available guidance treats medication import as a single regulatory process when it actually involves two separate government systems. Some sources focus exclusively on MHLW permit requirements while ignoring customs declaration obligations. Others assume that legal import automatically means no declaration is required.</p>
            
            <p>The regulatory complexity is genuine. The distinction between "prohibited with exceptions," "controlled with thresholds," and "permitted with conditions" creates nuanced requirements that simple binary classifications cannot capture. These distinctions matter at the border, where different officers enforce different sets of regulations.</p>
            
            <p>Most critically, existing guidance fails to recognize that Japan's definition of "psychotropic substances" refers specifically to their official controlled list, not the broader medical definition. This oversight leads to blanket statements about psychiatric medications that mislead travelers about actual requirements.</p>
            
            <p>In matters of medication import compliance, accuracy is essential. The consequences of misunderstanding these requirements extend far beyond travel inconvenience to potential criminal liability. Our classification system provides the clarity and completeness that traveler safety demands.</p>
